### Tasks

#### ~~1. API Data Sharing~~

**Goal**: Share logs and insights from external APIs or data providers to enhance functionality.

**Tasks**:

- **External API Integration for Logs**:
  - Connect to APIs that provide relevant data for your logging system (e.g., GitHub Actions logs or external error monitoring).
  - Create **data ingestion pipelines** for importing log data from third-party APIs.
  - **Transform and store incoming data** in your database.

**Example Integrations**:

- **GitHub Actions**: Pull workflow logs.
- **Cloud Monitoring APIs**: Import logs from AWS CloudWatch or Google Cloud Logging.

  **Stretch Goals**:

- Automate scheduled data pulls and merge them with existing logs.
- Provide real-time log updates when API data changes.

### Summary

This sprint focuses on making the logging application more powerful and inclusive by:

- **Enabling API-based log data sharing** to integrate external insights.

Optionally, split into separate sprints for focused work on each area if needed.
