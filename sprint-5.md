# Sprint 5: API Data Sharing and Accessibility Improvements

## Objective

Enable log data sharing between systems using APIs, and improve the application's accessibility for users with diverse needs.

---

### Tasks

#### 1. API Data Sharing

**Goal**: Share logs and insights from external APIs or data providers to enhance functionality.

**Tasks**:

- **External API Integration for Logs**:
  - Connect to APIs that provide relevant data for your logging system (e.g., GitHub Actions logs or external error monitoring).
  - Create **data ingestion pipelines** for importing log data from third-party APIs.
  - **Transform and store incoming data** in your database.

**Example Integrations**:

- **GitHub Actions**: Pull workflow logs.
- **Cloud Monitoring APIs**: Import logs from AWS CloudWatch or Google Cloud Logging.

**Security Considerations**:

- Use **OAuth 2.0** or **API tokens** for authenticating with external APIs.
- Handle rate limits and retries gracefully.

**Stretch Goals**:

- Automate scheduled data pulls and merge them with existing logs.
- Provide real-time log updates when API data changes.

#### 2. User Accessibility Testing

**Goal**: Ensure the application is accessible to all users, improving usability and compliance with accessibility standards.

**Tasks**:

- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Ensure all buttons, links, and inputs are navigable with `Tab` and `Enter` keys.
- **Screen Reader Support**:
  - Add **ARIA labels** for buttons, form inputs, and other interactive elements.
  - Provide meaningful labels for log severity and timestamps.
- **Color and Contrast**:
  - Check text and background color contrast to meet **WCAG 2.1 guidelines**.
  - Use contrast testing tools or simulators for color blindness.

**Tools**:

- Automated audits: **Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)**, **axe DevTools**.
- Manual testing for workflows: login, log viewing, filtering.

**Stretch Goals**:

- Add a **high-contrast mode** toggle.
- Implement a **text size adjuster** for readability.

### Summary

This sprint focuses on making the logging application more powerful and inclusive by:

- **Enabling API-based log data sharing** to integrate external insights.
- **Improving accessibility** with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast enhancements.

Optionally, split into separate sprints for focused work on each area if needed.
