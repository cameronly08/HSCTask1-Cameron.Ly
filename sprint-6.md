# Sprint 6: Addressing Security Concerns and Vulnerabilities

In this sprint, we focus on ensuring the absolute security of the application by addressing critical vulnerabilities that had previously been addressed at time of design but not at the highest level, including CSRF, XSS, broken authentication and session management, brute force attacks, and invalid forwarding and redirection.

## **Goals**

1. Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
2. Mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
3. Strengthen authentication and session management.
4. Protect against brute force attacks.
5. Prevent invalid forwarding and redirection.

---

## **Tasks**

### ~~**1. CSRF Protection**~~

- Use a CSRF protection mechanism such as Flask-WTF.
- Add `csrf_token` in forms to prevent unauthorized requests.

**Testing:** Submit forms without the CSRF token to ensure protection is enforced.

---

### ~~**2. XSS Mitigation**~~

- Sanitize and escape all user input to prevent malicious script injection.
- Use template rendering with safe escape mechanisms.

**Testing:** Attempt to inject scripts like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` to verify that it is escaped.

---

### ~~**3. Strengthening Authentication and Session Management**~~

- Use password hashing libraries (e.g., bcrypt).
- Configure secure session cookie settings.

---

### ~~**4. Brute Force Attack Prevention**~~

- Implement account lockout after repeated failed login attempts.
- Introduce CAPTCHA or other mechanisms for persistent failures.

**Testing:** Simulate multiple failed login attempts and ensure the account locks after a certain threshold.

---

### ~~**5. Preventing Invalid Forwarding and Redirection**~~

- Validate and sanitize all redirect URLs to ensure they are trusted.
- Use a fixed list of known, safe destinations rather than user-provided URLs.

**Testing:** Attempt to use unauthorized redirection to confirm that redirects only point to whitelisted URLs.

---

### **Deliverables**

1. CSRF protection added to all forms.
2. XSS prevention through input sanitization and escaping.
3. Secure password hashing and improved session cookie settings.
4. Brute force protection with account lockout mechanism.
5. Safe forwarding and redirection implemented.

---

### **Review Criteria**

- Verify forms reject requests without valid CSRF tokens.
- Ensure all user inputs are sanitized and no XSS vulnerabilities are present.
- Confirm secure session management with proper cookie configurations.
- Test brute force attack scenarios and validate account lockout behavior.
- Validate that redirects only go to safe URLs.

---

### **Next Steps**

- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints.
- Explore integrating security headers using `Flask-Talisman`.
